# BurgersGo

Welcome to BurgersGo! This is a web app built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) for the course CSC309 at the University of Toronto during the 2019 Winter semester. 

## Introduction

This web app is a burger builder website that simulates a real online burger ordering service, complete with regular user and admin functionality (albeit with a lot less actual burgers). Users can customize their burgers, place their order, see their past orders on the site, while admins have the power to modify all users and orders.  

## App Links

The web app is hosted on Heroku at the following link:
