## Deployment

Note: Do NOT worry about deployment when you are developing, as long as your changes have been pushed to the Github repo, we will deploy it at the end. 

The server is deployed through Heroku. 

### Steps

* Install the Heroku CLI interface.
* Sign up for an account on Heroku.
* Make sure you have been added as a collaborator in the app (Send a message to Ellen!)
* Add a git remote to the Heroku app's repository with this command: `heroku git:remote -a sleepy-lowlands-61784`.
* Add and commit your changes.
* When ready to deploy, first make sure you have the most up to date changes, then use this command: `git push heroku master`.
